#this class is responsible for controlling the evolution of each snake and sending instructions to the matin class - is maintains the population of snakes and passes them to a GA Object
#The GA object accepts this list of snakes and evolves them through the epoch method
#The GA then returns the list of snakes post evolution
#this list can then be used to draw each snake after simulating the snakes movement and drawing its coordinates
